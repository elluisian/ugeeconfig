     id="ugeeconfig.xml-documentation-on-the-gnulinux-platform">UgeeConfig.xml
     documentation on the GNU/Linux platform</h1>
     <p>In this document I will describe my findings related to the XML
     file ugeeTabletDriver uses as its config file for setting pen
     buttons, tablet keys and so on.</p>
     <p>Please note that I’m describing the linux version of the config
     file, as I work under there, to be precise, I work under Debian
     testing (Trixie, at the time of writing). I didn’t try the Windows
     version of the driver, so if things are implemented there but not
     here, I’m not aware, simply put.</p>
     <p>Please also note that this is just a “trial-and-error
     documentation”, no reverse engineering was performed, as my only
     goal was to set keystrokes easily, as keyboard events are totally
     diregarded in the official configuring program, making it hard to
     set those.</p>
     <p>Let’s start with the root node, which is named <em>UGEE</em> and
     it includes the following nodes:</p>
     <ul>
     <li><strong>PenTabletLists</strong>: It owns all the devices’
     definitions. It has a <em>version</em> attribute, presumably used
     to detect the particular version of this node’s “whole structure”
     (how the inner nodes are laid out that is);</li>
     <li><strong>DesktopShortcutKeys</strong>: It owns all the
     information related to the “shortcut keys window”, the one that may
     be used above everything else in-software (deskkeys in short from
     now on);</li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="desktopshortcutkeys-documentation">DesktopShortcutKeys
     documentation</h2>
     <p>This node owns only a few inner nodes:</p>
     <ul>
     <li><strong>Fixed</strong>: Will the deskkeys window be fixed or
     movable? 0 if fixed, 1 if not;</li>
     <li><strong>Zoom</strong>: The “zoom” feature for the deskkeys (it
     causes the actions’ icons to be bigger/smaller). Apparently the
     only supported values are “1”, “1.5” and “2”;</li>
     <li><strong>DisplayedAtCursor</strong>: I have no idea what this
     does, perhaps used in some other tablets? If not used at all, it
     probably would have been used so that the deskkeys window could be
     shown near the cursor (like a popup menu);</li>
     <li><strong>Rows</strong>: Number of rows available in the deskkeys
     window. According to the configuring program, the maximum should be
     4;</li>
     <li><strong>Columns</strong>: Number of columns available in the
     deskkeys window. According to the configuring program, the maximum
     should be 4;</li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="single-device-documentation">Single device
     documentation</h2>
     <p>Each device definition starts with a tag representing its code
     name, throughout this document, I will refer to the UE16 tablet as
     an example, as it happens this is the device I personally own.</p>
     <p>Basically, for the UE16, the node’s tag is “UE16”, for other
     models, it’s their code name.</p>
     <p>Every device node contains the following nodes:</p>
     <ul>
     <li><strong>DeviceInfo</strong>) Its inner nodes describe the
     features of the particular device:
     <ul>
     <li><strong>DeviceRingNum</strong>) As the name suggests, it is the
     number of available rings (can be thought as “knobs”) on the
     tablet. The UE16 for example features one of them, it is possible
     to assign two different actions to it, based on the particular
     rotation’s direction, be it clockwise or counterclockwise;</li>
     <li><strong>DeviceKeyNum</strong>) As the name suggests, it is the
     number of available physical keys on the tablet;</li>
     <li><strong>DevicePenType</strong>) It is an integer value that
     supposedly describes the features of the pen used by the tablet.
     Unfortunately, I can’t investigate further as I own only the
     UE16;</li>
     <li><strong>DeviceTrackpad</strong>) Not sure what this does,
     perhaps it establishes if the tablet can be treated as a
     trackpad;</li>
     <li><strong>DeviceControl</strong>) Not sure what this does;</li>
     <li><strong>DeviceKeyDirection</strong>) Only a few devices have
     this, I’m not sure what’s supposed to mean;</li>
     </ul></li>
     <li><strong>Common</strong>) Common properties, not related to
     “apps” (see below):
     <ul>
     <li><strong>ScreenMapping</strong>) It establishes what is the
     “walkable” area of the screen on the tablet when using the pen.
     This is used for those tablets that also feature a monitor, such as
     the UE16. Basically, with this option, it is possible to enlarge or
     restrict the reachable areas of the screen when using the pen to
     navigate:
     <ul>
     <li>The <em>id</em> attribute is used to record the dropdown menu
     choice, when selecting the monitor (0 is the first entry);</li>
     <li>Nodes <strong>SX</strong>, <strong>SY</strong>,
     <strong>SW</strong> and <strong>SH</strong> simply define, in
     pixel, the mapping (coordinate 0,0 is on the top-left);</li>
     </ul></li>
     <li><strong>TabletPannel</strong>) It establishes what is the
     usable area on the tablet that may be used to “walk the screen”.
     This is used for those tablets that also feature a monitor, such as
     the UE16. Basically, with this option, it is possible to determine
     the precise portion of the tablet screen that must be touched by
     the pen, in order to perform some kind of movement on the screen:
     <ul>
     <li>The <em>Orientation</em> attribute is used to determine the
     tablet’s orientation. 0 is standard, 1 is 90°, 2 is 180° and 3 is
     270°;</li>
     <li>Nodes <strong>TX</strong>, <strong>TY</strong>,
     <strong>TW</strong> and <strong>TH</strong> simply define, in
     pixel, the mapping (coordinate 0,0 is on the top-left);</li>
     </ul></li>
     <li><strong>DisableInfo</strong>) Show “messages” when using
     keys/rotating buttons, and so on (0 to enable, 1 to disable);</li>
     <li><strong>DisableQuickKey</strong>) Contrary to its
     counterintuitive name, this is used to determine if tablet keys
     should produce any input or not (0 to enable tablet keys input, 1
     to disable);</li>
     <li><strong>DisablePressure</strong>) Detect pen pressure (0 to
     enable, 1 to disable);</li>
     <li><strong>DisableSlope</strong>) Detect pen tilt (0 to enable, 1
     to disable);</li>
     <li><strong>PictureFiles</strong>) I don’t know where this is used.
     I speculate these represent the particular device’s images used in
     the configuring program, I’m not sure though:
     <ul>
     <li><strong>T_0</strong>) A rectangle described by the attributes
     <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>, <em>W</em> and <em>H</em>, all
     integers;</li>
     <li><strong>T_1</strong>) Same as <strong>T_0</strong>;</li>
     <li><strong>T_2</strong>) Same as <strong>T_0</strong>;</li>
     <li><strong>T_3</strong>) Same as <strong>T_0</strong>;</li>
     </ul></li>
     <li><strong>SC</strong>) I don’t know what this is supposed to be,
     not all devices have this:
     <ul>
     <li>attributes <em>fXY</em>, <em>fXLC</em>, <em>fYLC</em> and
     <em>fKX</em>: if <strong>SC</strong> is present, all of these are
     set to 1. I don’t know what these are;</li>
     </ul></li>
     </ul></li>
     <li><strong>CommonAPP</strong>) Common properties that apply
     regardless of the particular “app” (see below):
     <ul>
     <li><strong>Pen</strong>) Properties of the pen:
     <ul>
     <li><strong>PenBtn&lt;N&gt;</strong>) Particular pen button, its
     “tag number” <em>&lt;N&gt;</em> is important, as not all the
     devices have the same set of tag numbers. Some might even not
     present any button, in that case, this node is absent.
     <ul>
     <li>The <em>id</em> attribute is used to determine if a custom
     action is set, 1 if set, 0 if not;</li>
     <li>The <em>Actid</em> attribute is used to determine the default
     action of the button, when no custom action is set (also used
     during the config reset in the configuring program);</li>
     <li>If a custom action is set, the content is set to the action
     definition (see Action documentation for details);</li>
     </ul></li>
     <li><strong>P0</strong>, <strong>P1X</strong>, <strong>P1Y</strong>
     and <strong>P2</strong>) Respectively, starting point, middle point
     and ending point, these are used to represent the pressure curve.
     <strong>P0</strong> and <strong>P2</strong> represent the starting
     and ending X axis (with P0’s Y being 0 and P2’s Y being 1), the
     middle point on the other hand, have both X and Y axes;</li>
     <li><strong>TablePC</strong>) Not sure what this means, I’ve seen
     it’s always set to 1;</li>
     <li><strong>RelativeCoords</strong>) These are the settings related
     to “mouse mode”:
     <ul>
     <li>The <em>Speed</em> attribute is an integer from 0 to 10, with 5
     as its default;</li>
     <li>The content is set to 0 if disabled, 1 if enabled;</li>
     </ul></li>
     </ul></li>
     <li><strong>K</strong>) Description of tablet keys’s actions:
     <ul>
     <li><strong>K&lt;N&gt;</strong>) Particular tablet key, its “tag
     number” <em>&lt;N&gt;</em> is important, as not all the devices
     have the same set of tag numbers. Some might even not present any
     key, in that case, this node is absent:
     <ul>
     <li>The <em>id</em> attribute is used to determine if a custom
     action is set, 1 if set, 0 if not;</li>
     <li>The <em>Actid</em> attribute is used to determine the default
     action of the key, when no custom action is set (also used during
     the config reset in the configuring program);</li>
     <li>The <em>Motid</em> attribute is usually set exactly to the tag
     number of the particular key, this doesn’t apply to the “Q6” device
     for some reason, as the different “motids” are set backwards in
     respect to the tag number. I honestly don’t know what is supposed
     to mean;</li>
     <li>The <em>Show</em> attribute may have been used to hide entries,
     it doesn’t appear to work though. If I decide to set Show to 0 on
     one of the keys, the configuring program doesn’t run. Perhaps this
     was used during debugging? For some odd reason, UE16 has the 9th
     key, located at the center of the ring, set with Show=0, if it is
     changed to Show=1, the configuring program does not show up, but
     the driver works properly.</li>
     <li>If a custom action is set, the content is set to the action
     definition (see Action documentation for details);</li>
     </ul></li>
     </ul></li>
     <li><strong>R</strong>) Description of the first ring of the
     tablet. If the tablet has no rings, this node is absent. A ring may
     have multiple “wheel actions” (represented by the
     <strong>W</strong> node, see below):
     <ul>
     <li>the <em>id</em> attribute is used to determine what particular
     “wheel action” is used (0 is the first one);</li>
     <li><strong>W&lt;N&gt;</strong>) A single “wheel action”, which is
     basically a pair of actions, one for clockwise movement, the other
     for counterclockwise movement. Most tablets have up to 4 wheel
     actions, for some reason though, the LPU1102 has five of them:
     <ul>
     <li>The <em>id</em> attribute is used to determine the kind of
     action that is set. If 0, then the default action is set, if 1 then
     the wheel action has no effect, if 2, then a custom wheel action is
     set;</li>
     <li>If a custom wheel action is set, the content is set to the
     wheel action definition (see Action documentation for details, in
     particular “Action Type 4: wheel actions”);</li>
     <li>Please note that, contrary to the tags owning the
     <em>actid</em> attribute, it seems there is no way to change the
     default wheel action;</li>
     </ul></li>
     </ul></li>
     <li><strong>R2</strong>) Description of the second ring of the
     tablet. If the tablet has no rings or no second ring, this node is
     absent;
     <ul>
     <li>the <em>id</em> attribute is the same as
     <strong>R</strong>’s;</li>
     <li>the <em>mode</em> attribute is used to determine the “mode”…
     too bad I don’t know what that means;</li>
     <li><strong>W&lt;N&gt;</strong>) Same as <strong>R</strong>’s;</li>
     </ul></li>
     <li><strong>TR</strong>) Alternative description of the second ring
     of the tablet. For some reason, this is used, instead of “R2”, only
     on the LPU1505F device. Apart from that, it’s equivalent to
     <strong>R2</strong>;</li>
     </ul></li>
     <li><strong>Apps</strong>) Properties that apply to particular
     “apps”. As reported in “22.3.5 Applications and Others” of the page
     <a
     href="https://www.ugee.com/subsidiary/setup-ue16">https://www.ugee.com/subsidiary/setup-ue16</a>,
     it is possible to add per-app settings, unfortunately, it seems
     only the windows version of the drivers allows for this.
     <ul>
     <li><strong>app</strong>) A single app. For some reason, the
     configuring program makes only a single app entry, with <em>id</em>
     set to 0 and <em>name</em> set to 0… Is this some sort of default
     entry? Nonetheless, these “apps” are ignored on GNU/Linux, :
     <ul>
     <li>The <em>id</em> attribute is used for… well… I don’t know;</li>
     <li>The <em>name</em> attribute is used, I guess, to define a
     friendly name for the app;</li>
     <li><strong>path</strong>) A supposed path to an executable, I
     guess;</li>
     <li>The rest of tags mimic the ones contained in
     <strong>CommonAPP</strong>, except that, for some reason, the
     <strong>K</strong> nodes of the “id=0” app entry have no attributes
     besides <em>id</em>;</li>
     </ul></li>
     </ul></li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="action-documentation">Action documentation</h2>
     <p>Now, the reason I decided to develop ugeeconfig in the first
     place.</p>
     <p>The main problem I had was the configuring program completely
     ignoring input from keyboard, making it difficult to set custom
     actions as keystrokes for the tablet/pen. Other than that, even if
     enabled, “messages” would not show up, AT ALL. Other problems
     include the complete non-working of deskkeys and all the commands
     related to show/hide the configuring program and/or deskkeys
     window. I tinkered with the QT5 framework, but I was not capable of
     finding any way to solve and/or reproduce the problem reliably,
     because of that, I decided to make some kind of command-line
     editor, just to simplify things when defining custom actions, in
     the hope that in the future the remainder of bugs get solved.</p>
     <p>To set actions, there are two main ways:</p>
     <ul>
     <li><p>Default actions, identified by the <em>Actid</em> attribute.
     These can be set to <strong>K</strong> nodes (tablet keys and
     deskkeys) and <strong>PenBtn</strong> nodes;</p></li>
     <li><p>Custom actions, defined in the contents of the particular
     key/virtual key/button/wheel movement’s node;</p></li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="default-actions-the-actid-attribute">Default actions: the
     Actid attribute</h3>
     <p>In the context of the configuring program, actids are used to
     assign action to keys/buttons when no custom action is set. They
     are also used for resetting the configuration when choosing
     “restore configuration”. Theoretically, each keys/buttons/etc has
     its own particular default actionid that is immutable, in practice
     though, it is possible to force a particular actionid by writing it
     in the XML config file itself.</p>
     <p>Here follows the list of actionids that were found out during
     the development of ugeeconfig, these should be all, though I’m not
     sure:</p>

     <h3 id="custom-actions-action-type-n">Custom actions: Action type
     &lt;N&gt;</h3>
     <p>There are 8 types of custom actions, depending on the desired
     behaviour that one wants to assign to buttons/virtual
     keys/keys/wheel movements. The following paragraphs will describe
     each custom action type in detail.</p>
     <h3 id="action-type-1-keystroke">Action Type 1: Keystroke</h3>
     <p>When the particular key is pressed, one or more keystroke events
     are generated.</p>
     <p>Please note that this paragraph’s info is valid only for the
     GNU/Linux version of the driver, as it relies on X11
     keysyms/keycodes.</p>
     <p>Its format is:</p>
     <pre><code>1||&lt;label&gt;|&lt;keystrokes&gt;</code></pre>
     <p>where:</p>
     <ul>
     <li><p><code>&lt;label&gt;</code> is a string representing the
     keystrokes. The configuring program simply sets this to the name of
     all the entered keystrokes;</p></li>
     <li><p><code>&lt;keystrokes&gt;</code> is a list of comma-separated
     <code>&lt;keystroke&gt;</code> elements;</p></li>
     <li><p>A <code>&lt;keystroke&gt;</code> is made of one or multiple
     plus-separated <code>&lt;key&gt;</code> elements. A single
     <code>&lt;key&gt;</code> has the format
     <code>&lt;keysym&gt;:&lt;keycode&gt;</code> where
     <code>&lt;keysym&gt;</code> is the X keysym (in decimal) of the
     <code>&lt;key&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;keycode&gt;</code> is the
     keycode (in decimal) of the <code>&lt;key&gt;</code>. Both of them
     can be obtained by using the <code>xev</code> utility (remember to
     convert the keysym to decimal, in <code>xev</code> that is given in
     hexadecimal);</p></li>
     </ul>
     <p>Here’s an example:</p>
     <pre><code>1||Ctrl+Alt+A,Alt+B|65507:37+65513:64+97:38,65513:64+98:56</code></pre>
     <p>Let’s see why we get <code>65507:37+65513:64+97:38</code> for
     Ctrl+Alt+A and <code>65513:64+98:56</code> for Alt+B.<br />
     Run <code>xev</code> and gather the keys Ctrl, Alt, A and B. Here

     <p>From this output, it can be concluded that:</p>
     <ul>
     <li><p>For Ctrl, the keysym is 0xffe3 (65507 in decimal) and the

     “65507:37”;</p></li>
     <li><p>For Alt, the keysym is 0xffe9 (65513 in decimal) and the
     keycode is 64. Ergo, to represent it, one has to write
     “65513:64”;</p></li>
     <li><p>For A, the keysym is 0x61 (97 in decimal) and the keycode is
     38. Ergo, to represent it, one has to write “97:38”;</p></li>
     <li><p>For B, the keysym is 0x62 (98 in decimal) and the keycode is
     56. Ergo, to represent it, one has to write “98:56”;</p></li>

     <h3 id="action-type-2-mouse-key">Action Type 2: Mouse key</h3>
     <p>When the key is pressed, one or more mouse plus some arbitrary

     <pre><code>2||&lt;label&gt;|&lt;keys&gt;+&lt;click&gt;</code></pre>
     <p>where:</p>

     this to the name of all the entered keys/clicks;</p></li>
     <li><p><code>&lt;keys&gt;</code> is a set of one or more actids

     <h3 id="action-type-3-driver-functions">Action Type 3: Driver

     <p>This action type is strictly related to the interaction with the

     is:</p>
     <pre><code>3||&lt;label&gt;|&lt;function&gt;</code></pre>

3||Desktop shortcut keys|410</code></pre>
     <h3 id="action-type-5-executing-programs">Action Type 5: Executing
     programs</h3>
     <p>As the name suggests, with this action type, it is possible to
     press some keys in order to run executables. Its format is:</p>
     <pre><code>5||&lt;label&gt;|&lt;path&gt;</code></pre>
     <p>where:</p>
     <ul>
     <li><code>&lt;label&gt;</code> is a label for the executable. The
     configuring program sets this to the basename of the
     executable;</li>
     <li><code>&lt;path&gt;</code> is an absolute path to an executable.
     Command line arguments are not supported;</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Here follows an example:</p>

     <p>Here below are two examples:</p>
     <pre><code>6||Shutdown|602
6||Hibernate|603</code></pre>
     <h3 id="action-type-7-multimedia-functions">Action Type 7:
     Multimedia functions</h3>
     <p>This action type’s commands simply executes some multimedia
     actions (play/pause etc..).<br />
     Even when forced, this action type does not work on
     GNU/Linux.<br />
     Its format is the following:</p>
     <pre><code>7||&lt;label&gt;|&lt;multimediaop&gt;</code></pre>
     <p>where:</p>
     <ul>
     <li><code>&lt;label&gt;</code> is a label for the particular
     multimedia operation;</li>
     <li><code>&lt;multimediaop&gt;</code> is an actid among 701 to

     </ul>
     <p>An example of this is:</p>
     <pre><code>7||Previous|701</code></pre>
     <h3 id="action-type-10-unused">Action Type 10: Unused</h3>
     <p>This is used when selecting “no function”, that is, the
     button/key is not mapped to anything, not even it’s default action.
     Its format is:</p>
     <pre><code>10|No function|No function</code></pre>
     <p>In reality, the two texts are simple labels, they change
     according to the language, so it shouldn’t matter what is actually
     written there, what is actually important, is the “10” value.</p>
     <h3 id="action-type-4-wheel-actions">Action type 4: Wheel
     actions</h3>
     <p>Some tablets, like the UE16, have one or more “rings” (they are
     called “rollers” in the FAQs). These are rotable knobs that if
     rotated in a certain direction, a certain action is performed.</p>
     <p>For each ring, there are up to 4 possible wheel actions (that’s
     how I decided to call them, poor name, I know), that is, a pair of
     single actions, one for clockwise movement and the other for
     counterclockwise movement.<br />
     A ring can use only one wheel action at a time, but it is possible
     to cycle over them (with actids 405 and 406).</p>
     <p>This action type applies to the <strong>W&lt;N&gt;</strong>
     element, when it is set, its <em>id</em> attribute is set to 2 and
     its contents have the following format:</p>
     <pre><code>4|&lt;label&gt;|&lt;ccwlabel&gt;|&lt;cwlabel&gt;|&lt;ccwkstrokes&gt;|&lt;cwkstrokes&gt;</code></pre>
     <p>where:</p>
     <ul>
     <li><code>&lt;label&gt;</code> is supposed to be a label describing
     the pair of actions. As far as I noticed, the configuring program
     sets this to “custom”;</li>
     <li><code>&lt;ccwlabel&gt;</code> is the label for the
     counterclockwise action. The configuring program sets it based on
     the entered keys;</li>
     <li><code>&lt;cwlabel&gt;</code> is the label for the clockwise
     action. The configuring program sets it based on the entered
     keys;</li>
     <li><code>&lt;ccwstrokes&gt;</code> is a
     <code>&lt;keystrokes&gt;</code> element, as defined in the section
     “Action Type 1: Keystrokes”. This one is used when performing the
     counterclockwise movement;</li>
     <li><code>&lt;cwstrokes&gt;</code> is a
     <code>&lt;keystrokes&gt;</code> element, as defined in the section
     “Action Type 1: Keystrokes”. This one is used when performing the
     clockwise movement;</li>
     </ul>
     <p>As already said, contrary to other type of keys/buttons, the
     pair of custom actions can only be keystrokes, the same ones
     already treated in the section “Action Type 1: Keystrokes”.</p>
     <p>In the following example:</p>
     <pre><code>4|Customize|A|B|97:38|98:56</code></pre>
     <p>If a clockwise rotation is performed then the letter “A” will be
     produced, if a counterclockwise rotation is performed, “B” is
     produced.</p>
     <p>Please note that it is also possible to define only one of the
     two available custom action, consider the following:</p>
     <pre><code>4|Customize|A||97:38|</code></pre>
     <p>In this case, only the clockwise rotation produces something
     (“A”).</p>
